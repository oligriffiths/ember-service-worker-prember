[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/ember-service-worker-prember.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/ember-service-worker-prember)

An Ember Service Worker plugin that caches the html files from your static Ember app generated by [prember](https://github.com/ef4/prember)

## F#$& my assets aren't updating in development mode

Turn on the "Update on reload" setting in the `Application > Service Workers`
menu in the Chrome devtools.

## Installation

```
ember install ember-service-worker-prember
```

## Configuration

Configuration is optional. If you do not pass anything in, the urls you
already defined for `prember.urls` will be used by default.
Configuration is done in the `ember-cli-build.js` file:

```js
var EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  var app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    'esw-prember': {
      // Which urls to cache. This defaults to what you defined in your prember.urls config
      urls: ['/', '/foo', '/bar'],

      // changing this version number will bust the cache
      version: '1'
    }
  });

  return app.toTree();
};
```
